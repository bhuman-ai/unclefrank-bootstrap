# Project.md â€” Uncle Frank's Doc-Driven Development Platform

## Executive Summary
A revolutionary LLM-powered development platform that enforces structured, doc-driven workflows with Uncle Frank's no-BS approach. All development follows the immutable flow: Draft â†’ Validation â†’ Task â†’ Checkpoint â†’ Review â†’ Merge, with GitHub as the single source of truth and Fly.io as the execution infrastructure.

## Business Goals & Logic

### Core Value Proposition
- **Eliminate Development Chaos**: Every change follows a structured, validated workflow
- **Zero Lost Work**: GitHub Issues persist every task immediately upon creation
- **Autonomous Execution**: Tasks execute on Fly.io with Claude Code CLI managing sessions
- **Binary Pass/Fail**: Every checkpoint has clear, measurable success criteria
- **Human Escalation**: Smart escalation when automation hits limits

### Business Objectives
1. Reduce development cycle time by 70% through automated task execution
2. Eliminate context loss between planning and implementation
3. Ensure 100% traceability from requirement to deployment
4. Enable non-technical stakeholders to drive technical changes safely

## System Architecture

### Core Infrastructure
- **Fly.io Execution Server**: uncle-frank-claude.fly.dev
  - Persistent Claude sessions via tmux
  - Queue-based command injection
  - Real-time terminal streaming
  - Automatic session recovery

- **Vercel API Layer**: unclefrank-bootstrap.vercel.app
  - Project Draft Management

## Database Structures

```
/data/
  /drafts/          # Project.md drafts
    /draft-{id}/
      draft.json    # Metadata and state
      project.md    # Draft content
  
  /tasks/           # Task definitions
    /task-{id}/
      task.json     # Task details and checkpoints
  
  /checkpoints/     # Checkpoint execution
    /cp-{id}/
      checkpoint.json # Pass/fail criteria and logs
  
  /task-instances/  # Active execution instances
    /task-{id}/
      instance.json # Current state and progress
  
  /chains/          # Agent chain executions
    /chain-{id}.json
  
  /workflows/       # Multi-agent workflows

## Constraints & Design Philosophies

### Uncle Frank's Principles
1. **No BS**: Direct, actionable, measurable
2. **Binary Decisions**: Pass or fail, no maybe
3. **Escalate Fast**: Don't waste time on unsolvable problems
4. **Document Everything**: Full audit trail in GitHub
5. **Test Before Merge**: Every change validated before production

### Technical Constraints
- Maximum checkpoint execution: 30 minutes
- Maximum retries: 3 at checkpoint, 5 at resolver
- Session timeout: 2 hours
- Maximum concurrent instances: 10
- GitHub API rate limits respected

### Design Philosophy
- **Immutable Flow**: No bypassing the validated workflow
- **GitHub First**: All state persisted to GitHub immediately
- **Human in Loop**: Critical decisions require human approval
- **Progressive Automation**: Start simple, learn, improve
- **Fail Safe**: Errors escalate to humans, never fail silently

## Deployment Configuration

### Production Environment
- **Frontend**: unclefrank-bootstrap.vercel.app
- **API**: Vercel Serverless Functions
- **Executor**: uncle-frank-claude.fly.dev
- **Repository**: github.com/bhuman-ai/unclefrank-bootstrap
