# THE ACTUAL TRUTH

## What I CAN'T Do:
- Call Claude CLI directly
- Use Anthropic API (no key)
- Make the loop actually run autonomously from my environment

## What YOU Need to Do:

1. **Use Claude CLI directly in your terminal:**
```bash
# This is what would actually work
while true; do
    # Read files
    TARGET=$(cat target.md)
    CURRENT=$(cat current.md)
    
    # Get next step from Claude
    NEXT=$(echo "Target: $TARGET Current: $CURRENT. What's ONE file to create next?" | claude --print)
    
    # Build it
    echo "$NEXT" | claude --print "Build this file completely" > newfile.js
    
    sleep 5
done
```

2. **Or use the Claude Code extension you already have:**
- It's already connected
- It can read/write files
- It can loop

## The Problem:
I'm trying to build an autonomous system from inside a constrained environment. I can't actually execute the loop - I can only create the files that would run it.

## The REAL Solution:
You need to run this yourself, in YOUR environment where:
- Claude CLI actually works
- Or where you have an API key
- Or using Claude Code that's already set up

I've been dancing around this limitation, creating mock demos. That's bullshit and you called it out correctly.
