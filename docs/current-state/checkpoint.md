# Checkpoint.md â€” Current Checkpoint Reality

## The Truth: Checkpoints Don't Really Exist Yet

### What We Have
- **API Created**: `/api/checkpoint-decomposer.js` exists
- **Not Integrated**: Never called by the UI
- **Hardcoded Fallbacks**: Generic checkpoints that don't actually run

### Hardcoded Fallback (What Gets Created)
When checkpoint decomposer fails or isn't called:
```javascript
[
  {
    name: 'Setup and Dependencies',
    objective: 'Prepare environment and install dependencies',
    passCriteria: ['All dependencies installed successfully'],
    estimatedMinutes: 10
  },
  {
    name: 'Core Implementation',
    objective: 'Implement core functionality',
    passCriteria: ['Code compiles without errors'],
    estimatedMinutes: 25
  },
  {
    name: 'Testing and Validation',
    objective: 'Test implementation',
    passCriteria: ['All tests pass'],
    estimatedMinutes: 15
  }
]
```

### These Don't Actually Execute
- Created for show only
- No pass/fail checking
- No retry mechanism
- Claude ignores them

## What Actually Happens

### Task Execution Reality
1. **Entire task sent to Claude** as one message
2. **Claude does everything** in one go
3. **No checkpoint tracking** during execution
4. **Success = Claude completes** without error

### No Micro-Steps
Despite the code infrastructure:
- Tasks aren't broken down
- No incremental progress
- No rollback points
- All or nothing execution

## The APIs That Exist But Don't Work

### `/api/checkpoint-decomposer.js`
- **Purpose**: Break tasks into checkpoints
- **Status**: Deployed but never called
- **Would**: Use Claude to intelligently decompose
- **Reality**: Hardcoded fallbacks only

### Checkpoint Structure (Theoretical)
```json
{
  "id": "cp-task-123-abc",
  "name": "Implement API endpoint",
  "objective": "Create POST /api/users",
  "instructions": [
    "Create route handler",
    "Add validation",
    "Test endpoint"
  ],
  "passCriteria": [
    "Endpoint responds with 200",
    "Validation rejects bad input",
    "Tests pass"
  ],
  "status": "pending",
  "retryAttempts": 0,
  "maxRetries": 3
}
```

### This Never Happens
The above structure exists in code but:
- Never created for real tasks
- Never executed individually
- Never validated

## Pass/Fail Criteria (Not Implemented)

### What Should Happen
- Binary tests for each checkpoint
- Automatic validation
- Clear success/failure

### What Actually Happens
- Claude decides if it worked
- Human looks at output
- Subjective judgment

## No Checkpoint Monitoring

### The Dashboard That Doesn't Exist
The UI shows:
- "Checkpoints: Loading..." (never loads)
- "0/0 checkpoints complete" (always 0)
- No progress tracking

### No Real-Time Updates
- Can't see checkpoint progress
- No partial completion
- No checkpoint logs

## Checkpoint Storage (Unused)

### Directory Structure (Empty)
```
/data/checkpoints/
  /cp-{id}/           # Never created
    checkpoint.json   # Would have details
    logs.json        # Would have execution logs
```

### Nothing Gets Saved
- No checkpoint records
- No execution history
- No retry attempts

## The Retry System (Doesn't Work)

### Code Exists For
- 3 retries per checkpoint
- Escalation after failures
- Task-LLM-Resolver intervention

### But Actually
- No retries happen
- Failures are final
- No escalation occurs

## Why Checkpoints Matter (But Don't Exist)

### The Vision
- Granular execution control
- Clear progress tracking
- Ability to retry failed steps
- Rollback on failure

### The Reality
- Monolithic task execution
- Black box progress
- Manual intervention required
- Start over on failure

## Manual Checkpoint Process (What We Do)

### Human Checkpointing
1. Watch terminal output
2. See if each "step" completes
3. Mental note of what worked
4. Manually fix what didn't
5. Re-run if needed

### Informal Progress Tracking
- "Looks like it created the file"
- "I think the API is working"
- "The PR seems to be created"
- "Let me check if tests pass"

## Future State (Not Working)

### What's Built But Dormant
- Checkpoint decomposer agent
- Pass/fail validation logic
- Retry mechanism
- Progress tracking
- Escalation flow

### Activation Required
These features need:
1. UI integration
2. Claude response parsing
3. Status management
4. Error handling
5. Testing
