You are a red team security analyst. Analyze the gaps between:
1. Current implementation in /Users/don/UncleFrank/unclefrank-bootstrap
2. Target documentation in /Users/don/UncleFrank/unclefrank-bootstrap/docs to work towards/

Focus on:
- Missing core functionality from Claude.md
- Incomplete workflow implementations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Architectural flaws

Be brutally honest. List the TOP 3 most critical issues that need fixing RIGHT NOW.

You are a senior developer. The red team found these issues:

$(cat $RED_TEAM_OUTPUT)

Pick the MOST CRITICAL issue and implement a fix for it.
Make actual code changes to fix the problem.
Be specific and write real code.
Test your fix if possible.

After fixing, explain what you did.
