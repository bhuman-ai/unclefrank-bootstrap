# Project.md — Product PRD & Business Logic

## Purpose
This document represents the live Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the project.

## Draft Workflow
Any changes initiate a Project.md Draft following the sacred flow:
Draft → Validation → Task → Checkpoint → Review

## Draft Governance
There can only be one active Draft at any given time.
The Draft remains until all associated tasks are marked complete and approved by a human.

## Merge Policy
Only upon human-approved completion of all related tasks does the Draft merge into the Production Project.md.
